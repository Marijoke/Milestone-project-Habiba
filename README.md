# Project Habiba

Habiba is an up and coming UK R&B musician. 

As Habiba is new to the industry I am building a site that allows her to showcase her talent while providing new and exsiting fans what they want.
After a look into Habiba's fans and speaking with a few Habiba's fans wanted to know more about her life and what inspires her as well as her latest music and upcoming shows.
The artist also wanted people to know where, when and how they can book her and the types of events she does in order to get her name out there. Habiba's fans will get the information they wanted acros a few pages including a gallery page of personal and professional shots. They will also be given the opportunity to sign up to her mailing list and recieve exclusive content before anyone else. 
I decided to give the audience what they wanted which will span across a few pages. a place to learn about her, listen to and watch her latest projects. 

I researched her current brand image using her social media profiles that will be linked. I have spoken to a few supporters and fans who shared what information they like to have about their favorite artists and used this to create the pages and layout. 
I also looked at other musicans websites for inspiration during the planning process and while building the project.  
The website will follow the artists current branding colours which include a soft pink. 

I've used my mini projects to help guide me.  

why create this website?
Allow the artist to build a better relationship with her fans by providing them with more information about her and exclusive updates if they sign up to the mailing list. 
Allow interested parties to book her for work.
 
## UX
 
### Project goals
what is the primary need or use for this website?


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included a

who is this page for?
this page is for exsisting fans and people interested in Habiba and her music. The site will also allow people to sign up to a mailing list and submit a request to book her.


## Features

* Collapsable menu
* 


 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses Bootstrap to simplify layouts and create consistancy of design. 

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Created Wireframes for the project.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
